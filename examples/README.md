Examples
========

These were supposed be where NeHe style example programs go though obviously I haven't
gotten very far.  In general, programs that go here will be more straightforward, less interactive,
and have cleaner code than the free-for-all that is demos.

So far we have 3 programs in both C and C++, and the first 2 again in C but demoing using
the included standard shaders for a total of 8 separate programs.

There are also a couple misc. programs that probably shouldn't be
here since I mostly use(d) them for testing things, like various line
drawing methods and how much memory PGL uses in different configurations.


| Program | Description | Image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ex1.c/pp and ex1_std_shaders.c | Hello Triangle      | ![ex1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rswinkle/PortableGL/master/media/screenshots/ex1.png) |
| ex2.c/pp and ex2_std_shaders.c | Hello Interpolation | ![ex2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rswinkle/PortableGL/master/media/screenshots/ex2.png) |
| ex3.c/pp | Hello 3D + rotation | ![ex3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rswinkle/PortableGL/master/media/screenshots/ex3.png) |
| lines.c | line testing |  |
| minimal_pgl.c | Does nothing but initializes PGL and waits to exit, no visual |  |
