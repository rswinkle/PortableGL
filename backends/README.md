Backends
========

Simple starter programs (same as ex1 in examples) for different backends.
Could still use some polish but they work.

So far:

* win32, 2 programs one using BitBlt, one using stretchDIBits
* x11_xlib, 2 programs using xlib

TODO

* wayland
* I don't have a mac and but whatever the equivalent of win32 programs would be
* ???
