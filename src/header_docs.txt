Do this:
    #define PORTABLEGL_IMPLEMENTATION
before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the implementation.

If you plan on using your own 3D vector/matrix library rather than crsw_math
that is built into PortableGL and your names are the standard glsl vec[2-4],
mat[3-4] etc., define PGL_PREFIX_TYPES too before including portablegl to
prefix all those builtin types with pgl_ to avoid the clash. Note, if
you use PGL_PREFIX_TYPES and write your own shaders, the type for vertex_attribs
is also affected, changing from vec4* to pgl_vec4*.

You can check all the C++ examples and demos, I use my C++ rsw_math library.

// i.e. it should look like this:
#include ...
#include ...
#include ...
// if required
#define PGL_PREFIX_TYPES

#define PORTABLEGL_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "portablegl.h"

You can define PGL_ASSERT before the #include to avoid using assert.h.
You can define PGL_MALLOC, PGL_REALLOC, and PGL_FREE to avoid using malloc,
realloc, and free.
You can define PGL_MEMMOVE to avoid using memmove.

However, even if you define all of those before including portablegl, you
will still be using the standard library (math.h, string.h, stdlib.h, stdio.h
stdint.h, possibly others). It's not worth removing PortableGL's dependency on
the C standard library as it would make it far larger and more complicated
for no real benefit.


QUICK NOTES:
    Primarily of interest to game/graphics developers and other people who
    just want to play with the graphics pipeline and don't need peak
    performance or the the entirety of OpenGL or Vulkan features.

    For textures, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE is the only supported type.
    Internally, GL_RGBA is the only supported format, however other formats
    are converted automatically to RGBA unless PGL_DONT_CONVERT_TEXTURES is
    defined (in which case a format other than GL_RGBA is a GL_INVALID_ENUM
    error). The argument internalformat is ignored to ease porting.

    Only GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER is actually used internally but you can set the
    MIN_FILTER for a texture. Mipmaps are not supported (GenerateMipMap is
    a stub and the level argument is ignored/assumed 0) and *MIPMAP* filter
    settings are silently converted to NEAREST or LINEAR.

    8-bit per channel RGBA is the only supported format for the framebuffer.
    You can specify the order using the masks in init_glContext. Technically
    it'd be relatively trivial to add support for other formats but for now
    we use a u32* to access the buffer.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

Any PortableGL program has roughly this structure, with some things
possibly declared globally or passed around in function parameters
as needed:

    #define WIDTH 640
    #define HEIGHT 480

    // shaders are functions matching these prototypes
    void smooth_vs(float* vs_output, vec4* vertex_attribs, Shader_Builtins* builtins, void* uniforms);
    void smooth_fs(float* fs_input, Shader_Builtins* builtins, void* uniforms);

    typedef struct My_Uniforms {
        mat4 mvp_mat;
        vec4 v_color;
    } My_Uniforms;

    u32* backbuf = NULL;
    glContext the_context;

    if (!init_glContext(&the_context, &backbuf, WIDTH, HEIGHT, 32, 0x00FF0000, 0x0000FF00, 0x000000FF, 0xFF000000)) {
        puts("Failed to initialize glContext");
        exit(0);
    }

    // interpolation is an array with an entry of PGL_SMOOTH, PGL_FLAT or
    // PGL_NOPERSPECTIVE for each float being interpolated between the
    // vertex and fragment shaders.  Convenience macros are available
    // for 2, 3, and 4 components, ie
    // PGL_FLAT3 expands to PGL_FLAT, PGL_FLAT, PGL_FLAT

    // the last parameter is whether the fragment shader writes to
    // gl_FragDepth or discard. When it is false, PGL may do early
    // fragment processing (scissor, depth, stencil etc) for a minor
    // performance boost but canonicaly these happen after the frag
    // shader
    GLenum interpolation[4] = { PGL_SMOOTH4 };
    GLuint myshader = pglCreateProgram(smooth_vs, smooth_fs, 4, interpolation, GL_FALSE);
    glUseProgram(myshader);

    // Red is not actually used since we're using per vert color
    My_Uniform the_uniforms = { IDENTITY_MAT4(), Red };
    pglSetUniform(&the_uniforms);

    // Your standard OpenGL buffer setup etc. here
    // Like the compatibility profile, we allow/enable a default
    // VAO.  We also have a default shader program for the same reason,
    // something to fill index 0.
    // see implementation of init_glContext for details

    while (1) {

        // standard glDraw calls, switching shaders etc.

        // use backbuf however you want, whether that's blitting
        // it to some framebuffer in your GUI system, or even writing
        // it out to disk with something like stb_image_write.
    }

    free_glContext(&the_context);

    // compare with equivalent glsl below
    void smooth_vs(float* vs_output, vec4* vertex_attribs, Shader_Builtins* builtins, void* uniforms)
    {
        ((vec4*)vs_output)[0] = vertex_attribs[1]; //color

        builtins->gl_Position = mult_mat4_vec4(*((mat4*)uniforms), vertex_attribs[0]);
    }

    void smooth_fs(float* fs_input, Shader_Builtins* builtins, void* uniforms)
    {
        builtins->gl_FragColor = ((vec4*)fs_input)[0];
    }

    // note smooth is the default so this is the same as smooth out vec4 vary_color
    // https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Type_Qualifier_(GLSL)#Interpolation_qualifiers 
    uniform mvp_mat
    layout (location = 0) in vec4 in_vertex;
    layout (location = 1) in vec4 in_color;
    out vec4 vary_color;
    void main(void)
    {
        vary_color = in_color;
        gl_Position = mvp_mat * in_vertex;
    }

    in vec4 vary_color;
    out vec4 frag_color;
    void main(void)
    {
        frag_color = vary_color;
    }

That's basically it.  There are some other non-standard features like
pglSetInterp that lets you change the interpolation of a shader
whenever you want.  In real OpenGL you'd have to have 2 (or more) separate
but almost identical shaders to do that.


ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION
========================

We've already mentioned several configuration macros above but here are
all of them:

PGL_PREFIX_TYPES
    This prefixes the standard glsl types (and a couple other internal types)
    with pgl_ (ie vec2 becomes pgl_vec2)

PGL_ASSERT
PGL_MALLOC/PGL_REALLOC/PGL_FREE
PGL_MEMMOVE
    These overrride the standard functions of the same names

PGL_DONT_CONVERT_TEXTURES
    This makes passing PGL a texture with a format other than GL_RGBA an error.
    By default other types are automatically converted. You can perform the
    conversion manually using the function convert_format_to_packed_rgba().
    The included function convert_grayscale_to_rgba() is also useful,
    especially for font textures.

PGL_PREFIX_GLSL or PGL_SUFFIX_GLSL
    These replace PGL_EXCLUDE_GLSL. Since PGL depends on at least a few
    glsl functions and potentially more in the future it doesn't make
    sense to exclude GLSL entirely, especially since they're all inline so
    it really doesn't save you anything in the final executable.
    Instead, using one of these two macros you can change the handful of
    functions that are likely to cause a conflict with an external
    math library like glm (with a using declaration/directive of course).
    So smoothstep() would become either pgl_smoothstep() or smoothstepf(). So far it is less than
    10 functions that are modified but feel free to add more.

PGL_HERMITE_SMOOTHING
    Turn on hermite smoothing when doing linear interpolation of textures.
    It is not required by the spec and it does slow it down but it does
    look smoother so it's worth trying if you're curious. Note, most
    implementations do not use it.

PGL_BETTER_THICK_LINES
    If defined, use a more mathematically correct thick line drawing algorithm
    than the one in the official OpenGL spec.  It is about 15-17% slower but
    has the correct width. The default draws exactly width pixels in the
    minor axis, which results in only horizontal and vertical lines being
    correct. It also means the ends are not perpendicular to the line which
    looks worse the thicker the line.  The better algorithm is about what is
    specified for GL_LINE_SMOOTH/AA lines except without the actual
    anti-aliasing (ie no changes to the alpha channel).

PGL_DISABLE_COLOR_MASK
    If defined, color masking (which is set using glColorMask()) is ignored
    which provides some performance benefit though it varies depending on
    what you're doing.

PGL_EXCLUDE_STUBS
    If defined, PGL will exclude stubs for dozens of OpenGL functions that
    make porting existing OpenGL projects and reusing existing OpenGL
    helper/library code with PortableGL much easier.  This might make
    sense to define if you're starting a PGL project from scratch.

There are also these predefined maximums which you can change.
However, considering the performance limitations of PortableGL, they are
probably more than enough.

MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS and MAX_COLOR_ATTACHMENTS aren't used since those features aren't implemented.
PGL_MAX_VERTICES refers to the number of output vertices of a single draw call.
It's mostly there as a sanity check, not a real limitation.

#define PGL_MAX_VERTICES 500000
#define GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS 8
#define GL_MAX_VERTEX_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS (4*GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS)
#define GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS 4
#define GL_MAX_COLOR_ATTACHMENTS 4
