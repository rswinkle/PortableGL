Do this:
    #define PORTABLEGL_IMPLEMENTATION
before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the implementation.

If you plan on using your own 3D vector/matrix library rather than crsw_math
that is built into PortableGL and your names are the standard glsl vec[2-4],
mat[3-4] etc., define MANGLE_TYPES too before including portablegl to
prefix all those builtin types with glinternal_ to avoid the clash.

You can check all the C++ examples and demos, I use my C++ rsw_math library.

// i.e. it should look like this:
#include ...
#include ...
#include ...
// if required
#define MANGLE_TYPES

#define PORTABLEGL_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "portablegl.h"

I use my CVector library for various types in PortableGL so you *can* #define
CVEC_ASSERT, CVEC_MEMMOVE, and (mutually inclusive) CVEC_MALLOC, CVEC_REALLOC,
and CVEC_FREE before the #include to avoid using the standard library
versions.  However, currently, I use at least malloc, realloc, and memcpy in
PortableGL so doing so wouldn't actually avoid the standard library.  Creating
equivalent PortableGL macros (that would automagically apply to any internally
used cvectors) is a TODO I suppose.


QUICK NOTES:
    Primarily of interest to game/graphics developers and other people who
    just want to play with the graphics pipeline and don't need peak
    performance or the the entirety of OpenGL or Vulkan features.

    RGBA32 is the only currently supported format for textures

    Only GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER is actually used internally but you can set the
    MIN_FILTER for a texture.

    8-bit per channel RGBA is the only supported format for the framebuffer
    You can specify the order using the masks in init_glContext. Technically it'd be relatively
    trivial to add support for other formats but for now we use a u32* to access the buffer.

Any PortableGL program has roughly this structure, with some things
possibly declared globally or passed around in function parameters
as needed:

    #define WIDTH 640
    #define HEIGHT 480

    // shaders are functions matching thise prototypes
    void smooth_vs(float* vs_output, void* vertex_attribs, Shader_Builtins* builtins, void* uniforms);
    void smooth_fs(float* fs_input, Shader_Builtins* builtins, void* uniforms);

    typedef struct My_Uniforms {
        mat4 mvp_mat;
        vec4 v_color;
    } My_Uniforms;

    u32* backbuf;
    glContext the_context;

    if (!init_glContext(&the_context, &backbuf, WIDTH, HEIGHT, 32, 0x00FF0000, 0x0000FF00, 0x000000FF, 0xFF000000)) {
        puts("Failed to initialize glContext");
        exit(0);
    }
    set_glContext(&the_context);

    // interpolation is an array with an entry of SMOOTH, FLAT or
    // NOPERSPECTIVE for each float being interpolated between the
    // vertex and fragment shaders

    // the last parameter is whether the fragment shader writes to
    // gl_FragDepth or discard, but it's not currently used.  In the future I may
    // have a macro that enables early depth testing *if* that parameter is
    // false for a minor performance boost but canonicaly depth test happens
    // after frag shader (and scissoring)
    GLenum interpolation[4] = { SMOOTH, SMOOTH, SMOOTH, SMOOTH };
    GLuint myshader = pglCreateProgram(smooth_vs, smooth_fs, 4, interpolation, GL_FALSE);
    glUseProgram(myshader);

    My_Uniform the_uniforms;
    pglSetUniform(&the_uniforms);

    the_uniforms.v_color = Red; // not actually used, using per vert color
    memcpy(the_uniforms.mvp_mat, identity, sizeof(mat4));

    // Your standard OpenGL buffer setup etc. here
    // Like the compatibility profile, we allow/enable a default
    // VAO.  We also have a default shader program for the same reason,
    // something to fill index 0.
    // see implementation of init_glContext for details

    while (1) {

        // standard glDraw calls, switching shaders etc.

        // use backbuf however you want, whether that's blitting
        // it to some framebuffer in your GUI system, or even writing
        // it out to disk with something like stb_image_write.
    }

    free_glContext(&the_context);

    // compare with equivalent glsl below
    void smooth_vs(float* vs_output, void* vertex_attribs, Shader_Builtins* builtins, void* uniforms)
    {
        vec4* v_attribs = vertex_attribs;
        ((vec4*)vs_output)[0] = v_attribs[1]; //color

        builtins->gl_Position = mult_mat4_vec4(*((mat4*)uniforms), v_attribs[0]);
    }

    void smooth_fs(float* fs_input, Shader_Builtins* builtins, void* uniforms)
    {
        builtins->gl_FragColor = ((vec4*)fs_input)[0];
    }

    // note smooth is the default so this is the same as smooth out vec4 vary_color
    // https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Type_Qualifier_(GLSL)#Interpolation_qualifiers 
    uniform mvp_mat
    layout (location = 0) in vec4 in_vertex;
    layout (location = 1) in vec4 in_color;
    out vec4 vary_color;
    void main(void)
    {
        vary_color = in_color;
        gl_Position = mvp_mat * in_vertex;
    }

    in vec4 vary_color;
    out vec4 frag_color;
    void main(void)
    {
        frag_color = vary_color;
    }

That's basically it.  There are some other non-standard features like
pglSetInterp that lets you change the interpolation of a shader
whenever you want.  In real OpenGL you'd have to have 2 (or more) separate
but almost identical shaders to do that.

There are also these predefined maximums which, considering the performance
limitations of PortableGL, are probably more than enough.  MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS
isn't used since they're not currently supported anyway.

    #define MAX_VERTICES 500000
    #define GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS 16
    #define GL_MAX_VERTEX_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS 64
    #define GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS 8
